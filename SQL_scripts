### These are some SQL statements I used to create the table & add a unique key
### Note: did not include the statements to create user & database, you're on your own!




# This is the statement to create a new table based on the data source

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS coincap_raw (
	row_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	price_usd FLOAT, 
	symbol VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
	rank INT,
	coin_id VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
	volume_usd BIGINT,
	available_supply BIGINT,
	last_updated DATETIME NOT NULL,
	name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
	percent_change_1h FLOAT,
	percent_change_24h FLOAT,
	percent_change_7d FLOAT,
	price_btc FLOAT,
	
	PRIMARY KEY (row_id)
	);

	
	
# This is the statement to create a unique key based on symbol & last_updated

ALTER TABLE coincap_raw ADD UNIQUE KEY index1 (symbol, last_updated);
